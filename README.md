# My Personal Project

## Simple atm

Description:
- What does this application do? This application runs a **simple atm** with basic user interface and graphics.
- Anyone that would like to withdraw and deposit money into their own personal .
- This project interests me because I like to understand what happens behind the scenes of everything. This project is
going to be a much more simplified version of general atm's, but I will be able to build my knowledge
n how day-to-day machines like this work. The next time I would be able to walk up to an atm or a cash register,
I would be able to visualize what is actually going on under the hood.


##User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able make an account.
- As a user, I want to be able to deposit and withdraw from my atm.
- As a user, I want to be able to logout of the atm.
- As a user, I want to be able to make transfers in between accounts of an atm.

# My Personal Project

## Simple Chess

Description:
- What does this application do? This application runs a **simple game 
of chess** with basic user interface and graphics.
- With enough work and an appealing setup, this can potentially be **used
by many people who love the game of chess**.
- This project is of interest to be because I play chess myself, and I've
always wondered how these games are made. Furthermore, I would like
to put my coding skills to the test and see what I can do with a bunch 
of assorted characters in a file.
